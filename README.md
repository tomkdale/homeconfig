# homedir
Tom's linux 1 stop environment setup, run `./setup.sh` to setup desktop environment. If configuring a headless machine  then do the following from `headless/setup.sh ` Works for Redhat, Debian, and arch derivatives that run gnome.

## Standard Setup
1. `mkdir ~/productivity && git clone https://github.com/tomkdale/homeconfig.git ~/productivity/homeconfig`
2. ` sudo ~/productivity/homedir/setup.sh `
Done!

If you're not me then you probably don't actually want to do this. If you do, please don't do it on a machine that matters becuase I change a lot of settings just how I like them.
