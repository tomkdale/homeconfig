## Travis CI Extension for Visual Studio Code
Check the Travis CI build status of your project right in Visual Studio Code! This extension displays a small status indicator in the status bar.

It comes with two commands: `Update Status` and `Open in Travis`. It is enabled automatically if a `.travis.yml` is present in your project.

## Configuration
Travis uses a username/repository combination to find your test. By default, the extension will atempt to gather that information from your Git configuration, using the `origin` remote. So, if your repository lives in `https://github.com/felixrieseberg/bubblegum`, the extension will expect to find tests at `https://travis-ci.org/felixrieseberg/bubblegum`.

However, you can easily override that setting. Simply open or create `./.vscode/settings.json` and fill in the following fields:

```json
{
    "travis.repository": "electron",
    "travis.username": "atom"
}
```

By default, this extension will request a status update from Travis every 60 seconds. You can easily override this by changing the your `./.vscode/settings.json` file.

To disable polling entirely, you can use:

```json
{
    "travis.statusPolling": false
```

or to change the polling interval, you can use:

```json
{
    "travis.statusPollingInterval": 30
}
```

Which will set the polling interval to every 30 seconds. It is recommended that you don't attempt to poll for status changes too often.
